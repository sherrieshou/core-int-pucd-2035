		Hello World, my name is Sherrie. I am a “Beijinger”, although I lived in San Jose for 4 years and currently am a college student at New York. I’m a sophomore majoring in Communication Design at Parsons School of Design. Here are some Fun facts about me: <br/>I don't like to eat carrot. <br/>I loved dinosaur when I was little. <br/>I always dream to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br/>I always wish I could do Teleportation so that I don’t have to get up early everyday. <br/>I have watched 1000 episodes of Detective Conan.<br/>Favorite lyrics: City of stars, are you shining just for me?
